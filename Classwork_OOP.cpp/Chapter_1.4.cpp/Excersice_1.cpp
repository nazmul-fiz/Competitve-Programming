// This is a strange /* way to do a comment */

// In C++, a single-line comment starts with //.
// Everything after // on that line is ignored by the compiler.
// Therefore, the symbols /* and */ inside this comment
// are treated as normal text and do not start or end a block comment.


// Nesting a C-style comment inside a C++ single-line comment
// is valid and causes no compilation error.
